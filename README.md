Repo dedicated to all energy-related work that I have built

1. Coal or Nuclear - Differentiating Between Thermal Powerplants
   
   This project serves to build a model that can predict whether you're looking at a coal or nuclear powerplant. To the untrained eye,        they are tough to tell apart.

2. Oil Site Identification Using Satellite Imagery
   
   This project uses satellite imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada to differentiate between types of oil production sites.
